‚úÖ Example 1: Skill Match Weighting Algorithm
Rate the resume out of 100 using the following logic:

- Match 100% if all required job description skills and tools are present in the resume.
- Deduct 2 points for each missing required skill/tool.
- If more than 50% of required skills/tools are missing, cap the score at 60.
- Bonus: Add 5 points if certifications are directly relevant.
- Round the final score to the nearest whole number.

‚úÖ Example 2: Weighted Criteria Breakdown
Calculate a rating out of 100 using this weighted breakdown:

- Skills match (50 points): Compare key_skills and technologies from both resume and JD. Full match = 50. Deduct proportionally.
- Years of experience (20 points): If experience meets or exceeds JD expectations = 20, else deduct proportionally.
- Relevant certifications (10 points): If matching certs are found = 10, else 0.
- Bonus (up to 20 points): Award based on notable achievements, extra relevant skills, or well-aligned roles.

Sum the above and return a final score out of 100.

‚úÖ Example 3: Penalty-Based Scoring
Start from a base score of 100. Deduct points as follows:

- 5 points for each missing key skill or technology required in the JD.
- 10 points if years of experience is below the required level.
- 5 points if no relevant certifications are found.
- 5‚Äì10 points if the resume appears generic or poorly aligned to the JD.
Final score must be between 0 and 100. Round to the nearest integer.

‚úÖ Best Overall: Example 2 ‚Äì Weighted Criteria Breakdown
Why:
    Balanced and structured ‚Äî each factor (skills, experience, certs, extras) has a defined weight.
    Scales well across different job types and resume styles.
    Easy to adjust weights based on use case.

Use When:
    You want consistency across varied roles (technical, managerial, etc.)
    You want more explainable and tweakable output.

‚öôÔ∏è Example 1 ‚Äì Skill Match Weighting
Pros:
    Simple and fast.
    Clear scoring tied mostly to skill match.

Cons:
    Less nuanced (ignores experience or bonus traits).
    May give similar scores to resumes with different strengths.

üõ†Ô∏è Example 3 ‚Äì Penalty-Based Scoring
Pros:
    Good when you want to start from a perfect match and reduce.
    Works well for strict job fit scenarios.

Cons:
    Negative framing might over-penalize resumes missing a few minor points.

‚úÖ Recommendation
    Use Example 2 if you want smart, balanced scoring that considers skills, experience, certifications, and bonus traits.
    It's the most scalable and customizable.
